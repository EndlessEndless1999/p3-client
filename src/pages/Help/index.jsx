        <br />
        <strong>ATTACK:</strong> Deal damage to enemies
        <br />
        <strong>HEAL:</strong>Restore your robot's health
        <br />
        <strong>SHIELD:</strong> Protect your robot from enemy attacks
        <br />
        <strong>RUN:</strong>RUN: Attempt to escape from the encounter
      </p>
      <p>
        Be quick in making your decisions because you only have a limited time before the enemies attack!
      </p>
      <p>
        Your adventure will continue until you either meet your demise or defeat the final boss.

        Get ready for an exciting and challenging journey on the unexplored planet!
