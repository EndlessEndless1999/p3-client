      <p>Welcome to "Title Here: The Language of Coding"!</p>

      <h3>Objective</h3>
      <p>
        You are a cowardly scientist who has crash-landed on an unexplored planet, and your goal is to survive for as long as possible with the help of your trusty robot companion.
      </p>

      <h3>Gameplay</h3>
      <p>
        The game features turn-based combat encounters where you must program your robot to perform actions: ATTACK, HEAL, SHIELD, or RUN.<br />
        Each turn, you have a limited amount of time to program your robot before enemies attack.<br />
        Be strategic in your choices to defeat enemies and stay alive.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your robot takes damage, your code will become filled with bugs. You must debug your script to make the robot function properly again.
      <br />
        Your journey continues until you either succumb to the challenges or defeat a final boss.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Good luck, brave scientist! It's time to show your coding skills and conquer the challenges of the unexplored planet.</p>
